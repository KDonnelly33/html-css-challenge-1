# HTML

## I rewrote the structure of the HTML file to follow semantic guidelines. This include changing <div> to <section> or <nav> of whatever fit for its purpose. I made sure <h1>,<h2> etc. were all in order.

# CSS

## I rewote the css file to remove any repetitve elements. After i commented what each class is doing.
